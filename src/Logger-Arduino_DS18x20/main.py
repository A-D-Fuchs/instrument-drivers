                    <p>Use this driver to read one or multiple temperature sensor of the DS18x20 family using an Arduino.</p>
                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Enter the number of connected sensors so that the driver can check whether all sensors are connected.</li>
                    <li>Use the field "Variable names" to give each sensor a specific meaning. You can keep the field free to us standard names like "Temperature 1" etc.</li>
                    <li>To speed up readings, the field "Wait for conversion" is switched off by default. In this case, the Arduino continuously triggers new readings in an internal loop and the requested value is the last known value. In order to trigger a new reading when requesting a temperature, please check "Wait for conversion".</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Preparations:</strong></p>
                    <p>Before the first measurement, one has to upload the ino file that comes with this driver to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE. The libraries OneWire.h and DallasTemperature.h need to be installed using the ArduinoIDE as well. You can update them using the Library manager of the Arduino IDE The readout pin is D2.</p>
                    <p>Please connect the data wire of your sensor to this readout pin D2.</p>
                    <p>Typically, a 4.7KOhm resistor is needed between +5V and the readout pin. An existing parasite mode, meaning that Vdd gets power from the data line via the resistor, is not recommended. Multiple sensors can be connected to the same readout pin D2 of the Arduino. If many sensors are used, it could help to add 100 Ohm resistors into the data line of each sensor to prevent cross-talk. The sensors are found and enumerated always in the same way depending on their unique ID.</p>
                    <p>To get a list of all addresses, one can send the command "Addresses?" using the Arduino IDE.&nbsp;</p>
